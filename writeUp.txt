I. Abstract 

This paper is titled Understanding an HTTP Server through C++ and quite literally I aim to do just that, and what "that" is,
is to achieve three separate but related goals. The first being that I seek to deepen my software engineering skils through
designing a scalable and modular HTTP server, hopefully gaining an understanding of backend development and network programming. 
Second, I intend to provide a well-structured guide or tutorial that effectively conveys the fundamental concepts and 
implementation details of this project, making it accessible to others interested in learning.
Finally, this project will serve as a proof of concept—a demonstration of both technical skill and practical 
application—potentially contributing to future opportunities for gainful employment in software development.
